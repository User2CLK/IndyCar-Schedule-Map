# IndyCar-Schedule-Map
This web map explores the 2025 IndyCar racing series calendar in its 15 sites throughout the U.S. and Canada. 

This application serves to inform the user of the races and locations of the 2025 IndyCar Racing season. This racing circuit travels to 15 different sites in 11 U.S. states and one Canadian province. I personally am very interested in this racing series and wanted to channel that passion into a widely available resource for others to view and learn about. The main objectives of my project at the outset were to display the widespread nature of the IndyCar circuit and the unique natures of each track the circuit races at. This is why I included track details, descriptions, URLs, and pictures in each clickable track layout. I hope this map serves as an approachable way for someone to be able to approach the IndyCar series and get interested in it as it is compelling and easy to follow with its very much "local" feel with all of the events being within North America and them being in approachable, rekatively low-cost events. The article I used to build this application is the official IndyCar schedule hosted on the NTT IndyCar Series website, at https://www.indycar.com/Schedule.
